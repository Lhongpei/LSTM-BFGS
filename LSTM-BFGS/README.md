# LSTM-BFGS

## Introduction

- PDF file "LSTM-BFGS" is our project report.
- opti_utils.py is some function we implement.<br>
- Data_generate.ipynb is used to generate data folder named data_balanced.<br>
- BFPS-simple-ls.ipynb is a simple version of our work and objective function is Least Square<br>
- BFPS-LR_real_data.ipynb is our method for Linear Regression Function with real data, and a part to generate sample stored in folder called "sample". 
- torchmin is a package of optimization algorithm we download as baseline(we share the link in our report)
